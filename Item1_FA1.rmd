- Item 1 :
 Write the skewness program, and use it to calculate the skewness coefficient of the four examination subjects in results.txt (results.csv). What can you say about these data?
Pearson has given an approximate formula for the skewness that is easier to calculate than the exact formula given in Equation 2.1.

```{r setup, include=TRUE}

results <- read.table("results.txt", header=TRUE, na.strings="NA")

pearson_skewness <- function(x) {
  x <- na.omit(x)
  mean_x <- mean(x)
  median_x <- median(x)
  sd_x <- sd(x)
  return(3 * (mean_x - median_x) / sd_x)
}

skewness_values <- sapply(results[, 2:5], pearson_skewness)
```
```{r}
summary(results[2:5])
skewness_values
```

The interpretation of this result is that it is left-skewed, which means that there are more high scores and only some low outliers.
